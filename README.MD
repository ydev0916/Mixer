# SingleStory - HackGSU Fall 2020

## About
SingleStory is a program that emphasizes the value of a workers' unique identities, backgrounds, and experiences. Our application which works with Firebase analytics is based on a profile questionnaire for each user so they can generate a story about their culture and background.

Our goal is to partner with and provide this service for companies so that they can fully empower their workers and embrace diverse teams and perspectives.

## Mobile App
The Mobile App allows users to create an profile for themselves. They can then perform a trivia challenge on other people's profiles to get an idea of their
culture.

Here is a screenshot of the genre selection inside the app.
