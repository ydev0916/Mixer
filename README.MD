## About
SingleStory is a program that emphasizes the value of a workers' unique identities, backgrounds, and experiences. Our application which works with Firebase analytics 
is based on a profile questionnaire for each user so they can generate a story about their culture and background.

Our goal is to partner with and provide this service for companies so that they can fully empower their workers and embrace diverse teams and perspectives.
